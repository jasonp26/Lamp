The first step to installing MySQL on Centos is to run the following command.

# Installing MariaDB

$ sudo yum install mariadb-server

You then need to ensure that the DB service is started and enabled to start during system reboots

$ sudo systemctl start mariadb
$ sudo systemctl enable mariadb

To check the status of the service:

$ sudo systemctl status mariadb

# Securing MariaDB

$ sudo mysql_secure_installation

#Testing MariaDB (MySQL)

$ mysqladmin -u root -p version
